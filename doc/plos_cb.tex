\section*{Abstract}

The authors present a Bayesian spatial analysis of Duffy negativity and \emph{P. vivax} endemicity in trans-Sahelian Africa. The Duffy negativity dataset contains a mixture of records derived from three different assays of blood-group phenotype, as well as two different assays of genotype. The \emph{P. vivax} dataset contains records of endemicity, the times at which surveys were performed and the ages of the survey participants. The statistical model links all of these data sources in a coherent, scientifically defensible manner. The predictions of \emph{P. vivax} endemicity and Duffy negativity are informed by both datasets, resulting in improved accuracy and precision relative to what is possible using either dataset alone. The coherency of the model makes it possible to generate a wide variety of predictions, with fully quantified uncertainty.

\section*{Author Summary}

Issues in public health and epidemiology are complex and interrelated. Bayesian statistics is a statistical paradigm that makes it possible incorporate data from many disparate sources in a sensible way. In this paper, we combine two very different but related datasets in the same Bayesian geographical-statistical analysis. \emph{Plasmodium vivax} is a strain of human malaria, and Duffy negativity is a genetic trait that protects people from it. By combining data on the prevalence of each, we are able to produce better predictions of \emph{P. vivax} infection prevalence and Duffy negativity prevalence than we could using either source of data in isolation.

\section*{Introduction}

\emph{P. vivax} is increasingly being recognized as a tropical disease with serious public health implications. \textbf{Carlos/ Simon: some epidemiological context}

Duffy negativity is a genetic trait known to be very strongly related to \emph{P. vivax} in the sense that carriers (with few exceptions) are refractory to \emph{P. vivax} infection. \textbf{Ros: Brief introduction to Duffy and Duffy/vivax interaction}

\medskip
The Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) has assembled a comprehensive global database of Duffy blood group records \cite{howes:2010}, and is in the process of assembling a global database of observations of \emph{P. vivax} endemicity. The data abstraction protocols for the latter are described in \textbf{cite}. The eventual purpose of both data collection efforts is to produce evidence-based global predictions of \emph{P. vivax} endemicity. For the purpose of methodological exposition, in this paper we focus on the subset of both datasets in trans-Sahelian Africa (figure \ref{fig:datasets}). The spatial distributions of the two datasets suggest that the Duffy negativity data are a useful addition. The available \emph{P. vivax} data are highly concentrated in Ethiopia and the Sudan, while the Duffy dataset has much better coverage of West Africa.

All of the \emph{P. vivax} datapoints represent community-based prevalence surveys \textbf{CITE}. The full Duffy database presented by Howes et al. \cite{howes:2010} contains five types of records, but the window considered in the current study contains three. \textbf{Description of gen, phe and aphe datatypes from Ros.}}

Combining the two datasets is not straightforward using standard geostatistical methods. \textbf{Pete please make sure I'm talking sense here.} It is not appropriate to model Duffy negativity as a linear predictor of \emph{P. vivax} endemicity \cite{goovaerts:1997,wackernagel:2003} or its log-odds ratio \cite{banerjee:2004,mccullagh:1999}. The simple mathematical relationship between Duffy negativity $p_0$ and \emph{P. vivax} endemicity $p_v$ is that $p_v\le 1-p_0$ everywhere. This relationship is inconvenient to capture in the linear model and generalized linear model frameworks. Similar considerations make standard multivariate methods such as cokriging \cite{wackernagel:2003} and a spatial version of the multivariate GLM \cite{mccullagh:1999} for multinomial data seem to be the wrong tools for the job.

\medskip
On the other hand, it is quite straightforward to combine the datasets in a Bayesian hierarchical model. The development of the model follows the scientific reasoning closely. First, two standard spatial generalized linear models are constructed to describe the respective frequencies of the genetic variants at the two loci that determine Duffy blood group. These frequencies are related to the heterogeneous records in the Duffy negativity database using simple population genetics. Then, a spatiotemporal, seasonal GLM along the lines of Hay et al. \cite{hay:2007}  is constructed to describe \emph{P. vivax} endemicity within non-Duffy negative individuals.

The model development proceeds in the direction that makes scientific sense: \emph{P. vivax} endemicity is mediated by Duffy negativity prevalence over intra-generational timescales. However, information `flows in both directions' in that the \emph{P. vivax} observations provide information about Duffy negativity as well as the converse. Analyzing the datasets together results in better-informed predictions for both attributes.
